```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

The goal of this week's assignment is to get practice using an API. I wanted to look at recent movies. 

```{r}
res <- GET("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?api-key=r3uz0WM43M17EmziwdtqT9UCmgy3hShu")

raw <- jsonlite::fromJSON(unlist(rawToChar(res$content)))

movie_df<- data.frame(raw$results)
```

In conclusion, even though I fulfilled the assignment I really need to practice some more with using API's.
